# COM3D2.Interlewd


This is a small plugin to prevent a freeze when a personality bound script (.ks) is missing whatever the reason (forced unlock, missing update, Kiss).

- Instead the plugin will pick a similar event/yotogi from another personality and roll with it.
- Of course this will result in mismatched voice/behaviour but that's the easiest way to cover all case of figure.
- In the end this is the same kind of plugin than EEH where the issue isn't fixed, only dealt with in a non-disruptive way.

In addition the log will add a clear warning with compatible personalities

J1_FT_00033.ks doesn't exist.  
This yotogi or event is currently NOT available for Wary  
This yotogi or event is currently ONLY available for Muku  
To avoid a game freeze, Interlewd will use A1_FT_00033.ks until next game restart.  
VOICE and BEHAVIOUR will NOT match your currently selected maid's personality, this is expected!
